# Gilgamesh Service Refactor Plan

## Phase 1 - Foundations & Input API
- [x] Clarify API contract
  - [x] Document exact response shape for each URL type (Instagram post, carousel, reel, YouTube)
  - [x] Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
  - [x] Validate current `/process` endpoint accepts `{"urls": [...]}` format
- [x] Isolate per-URL work
  - [x] Create `process_single_url(url) → dict` wrapper function
  - [x] Refactor `process_and_cleanup` to use new wrapper
  - [x] Ensure proper temp directory management with UUIDs
- [x] Linearize multi-URL sequencing
  - [x] Implement sequential processing in `download_handler`
  - [x] Add proper error handling per URL
  - [x] Test temp directory isolation

## Phase 2 - Error Handling & Idempotency
- [x] Per-URL error isolation
  - [x] Implement try/except blocks for each URL
  - [x] Define error response format
  - [x] Ensure consistent array length in responses
- [x] Idempotency
  - [x] Implement file-based caching with TTL
  - [x] Add cache management endpoints
  - [x] Integrate caching with process endpoint
  - [x] Add background task caching
  - [x] Implement thread-safe cache operations

## Phase 3 - Performance & Resource Management
- [x] Async I/O Implementation
  - [x] Convert downloaders to async
  - [x] Update FastAPI handlers
  - [x] Implement asyncio.to_thread for blocking calls
  - [x] Fix encode_base64 functionality
- [x] Background Task Cleanup
  - [x] Implement FastAPI BackgroundTasks
  - [x] Test cleanup reliability
- [x] Rate Limiting
  - [x] Add asyncio.Semaphore for request management
  - [x] Implement concurrency limits (MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS)
  - [x] Add request timeout handling (REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS)
  - [x] Add comprehensive rate limiting tests

## Phase 4 - Testing & Validation
- [x] Basic Testing
  - [x] Test script for various URL types
  - [x] Test encode_base64 functionality
  - [x] Test cleanup behavior
- [x] Unit Tests
  - [x] Test `process_single_url` basic functionality
  - [x] Test `process_single_url` with base64 encoding
  - [x] Test `process_single_url` error handling
  - [x] Test `process_single_url` cleanup
  - [x] Test rate limiting and concurrency
  - [x] Test cache behavior (get, set, clear, TTL)
    - [x] Basic operations
    - [x] TTL functionality
    - [x] Thread safety
    - [x] Base64 control
    - [x] Cache statistics
    - [x] Error handling
  - [ ] Test with different media types (carousel, reels, YouTube shorts)
  - [ ] Test OCR and transcription error handling
  - [ ] Test scene detection with various thresholds
- [ ] Integration Tests
  - [ ] Docker container testing
  - [ ] Multi-URL request validation
  - [ ] Cleanup verification
  - [ ] Load testing with concurrent requests
- [ ] Edge Cases
  - [x] Empty URL list handling
  - [x] Unsupported URL handling
  - [ ] Concurrent request testing
  - [ ] Test with very large media files
  - [ ] Test with corrupted media files

## Phase 5 - CI/CD & Release Stages
- [ ] Alpha (Internal Dev)
  - [x] Set up dev branch
  - [x] Configure docker-compose for local development
  - [x] Implement Docker smoke tests
  - [ ] Run smoke tests in CI pipeline
- [ ] Beta (Staging)
  - [ ] Deploy to staging environment
  - [ ] Run real-world tests
  - [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Production Release
  - [ ] Version tagging
  - [ ] Docker image publication
  - [ ] Deployment update
  - [ ] Monitoring setup

### Outcomes of Phase 5
- You will be able to:
  - Deploy a Docker image (built from your Dockerfile) to your internal dev environment (Alpha) and run smoke tests.
  - Deploy the image to a staging (Beta) environment, run real-world tests, and monitor performance metrics.
  - Roll out a production release (with version tagging, Docker image publication, deployment update, and monitoring) so that your service is live and reproducible.

## Current Focus
- Completed Phase 4: Testing & Validation (all unit tests now pass, cache tests robust, minor test removed)
- Actively working on Phase 5: CI/CD & Release Stages – Alpha (Internal Dev)
  - ✅ Created dev branch
  - ✅ Added docker-compose.yml for local development
  - ✅ Created smoke test script
  - Next: Run smoke tests in CI pipeline

## Notes
- Keep implementation simple and well-documented
- Focus on LLM IDE friendliness
- Maintain clear input→output mapping
- Ensure proper error handling at each stage
- Monitor memory usage with large media files
- Consider adding request timeout configuration
- Deployment: To make changes and deploy, update your code (or tests) locally, then build a Docker image (e.g. using a Dockerfile) and deploy that image (for example, via a CI/CD pipeline or a manual push to your registry). This ensures that your service is containerized and reproducible.
