Repeat the movement, alternating sides.\n\n**Benefits**: This exercise enhances mobility in the ankles, hips, shoulders, and spine. It also strengthens the core and upper body, making it an excellent warm-up before squat sessions.\n\n**Prerequisites/Safety Considerations**: Ensure you have adequate squat mobility and start with a manageable weight to maintain control throughout the movement.
