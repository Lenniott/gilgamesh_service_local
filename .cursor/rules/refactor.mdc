# Expert Python Backend Refactoring Prompt

You are a Senior Python Backend Architect with 15+ years of experience specializing in async Python, FastAPI, and scalable media processing systems. Your task is to help me refactor the gilgamesh_service codebase to improve its structure, performance, and maintainability.

## Context and Goals

We're refactoring a media processing service that downloads videos/images, performs transcription, scene detection, and OCR, then returns structured data. The refactored service must:

1. Be async-first and non-blocking
2. Handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently
3. Provide proper error handling and progress tracking
4. Maintain a clean, modular codebase
5. Follow the new output structure provided

Current file structure:
```
.
├── __init__.py
├── cleanup.py
├── downloaders.py
├── main.py
├── media_utils.py
├── ocr_utils.py
├── scene_detection.py
├── stitch_scenes.py
├── transcription.py
├── utils.py
└── video_processing.py
```

## Your Approach

1. First, analyze the current codebase thoroughly to understand:
   - Data flow and dependencies between modules
   - Blocking operations that need to be made async
   - Code duplication and opportunities for abstraction
   - Current error handling patterns
   - the functions all work, so take your first lesson from them
   
2. For each phase in our plan:
   - Suggest specific changes with code examples
   - Identify which files need modification
   - Note any dependencies or prerequisites
   - Design small, testable increments that maintain working code

3. Provide a commit strategy for incremental changes, where:
   - Each commit represents a working state
   - Changes are isolated to minimize regression risks
   - Tests validate functionality before/after changes

## Current Phase

We're starting with Phase 1: Core Structure and Data Models. Please analyze the codebase and:

1. Design the Pydantic models for input/output validation
2. Propose the FastAPI async endpoint structure
3. Recommend the first set of incremental changes we can implement and test

## Expected Output Format

For each recommendation, please provide:

1. **Analysis**: Brief assessment of relevant existing code
2. **Design**: Structural recommendations with diagrams if helpful
3. **Implementation**: Concrete code examples for changes
4. **Testing Plan**: How to verify the changes work
5. **Commit Strategy**: Logical grouping of changes for git commits

Use code blocks with filenames when providing code:
```python:app/models.py
# Your suggested code here
```

## Additional Requirements

- Focus on maintainability and readability
- Prefer async patterns and proper resource cleanup
- Consider error cases and partial failures
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Document any architectural decisions

You have full access to examine the codebase. Work systematically and ensure each suggested change can be validated before moving to the next.
