# Project Rewrite Documentation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step process for documenting the entire Gilgamesh Service architecture to enable a complete rewrite from scratch.

## Goals
- Create comprehensive documentation for rebuilding the project from scratch
- Break down the documentation into manageable chunks that fit within context windows
- Ensure all dependencies, configurations, and architectural decisions are captured
- Enable a clean, maintainable rewrite with better structure and performance

## Documentation Structure

### Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure
1. **Environment & Configuration**
   - Environment variables and their purposes
   - Configuration files and settings
   - Development vs production configurations

2. **Project Structure & Dependencies**
   - Complete folder structure
   - requirements.txt with all dependencies
   - Package management and virtual environments

3. **Database Architecture**
   - PostgreSQL schema and tables
   - Table relationships and constraints
   - Indexes and performance optimizations
   - Database connection management

4. **Vector Store Setup**
   - Qdrant collections and schemas
   - Vector dimensions and metadata
   - Embedding strategies and models

### Phase 2: Core Systems
5. **File Storage System**
   - Clip storage architecture
   - File organization and naming conventions
   - Storage quotas and cleanup policies
   - Backup and recovery strategies

6. **AI Pipeline Architecture**
   - Scene detection and analysis
   - Transcription pipeline
   - AI rate limiting and circuit breakers
   - Model selection and fallbacks

7. **Video Processing Pipeline**
   - Video download and processing
   - Clip extraction and storage
   - Video compilation and stitching
   - Performance optimizations

### Phase 3: API & Services
8. **API Design & Endpoints**
   - REST API structure
   - Request/response schemas
   - Authentication and rate limiting
   - Error handling and validation

9. **Background Services**
   - Task queues and job processing
   - Scheduled tasks and maintenance
   - Monitoring and logging
   - Health checks and alerts

### Phase 4: Deployment & Operations
10. **Docker Configuration**
    - Dockerfile and multi-stage builds
    - Docker Compose setup
    - Volume mounts and networking
    - Environment-specific configurations

11. **Deployment Architecture**
    - Production deployment strategy
    - Load balancing and scaling
    - Monitoring and observability
    - Backup and disaster recovery

12. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
    - Testing strategy and frameworks
    - Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
    - Performance testing and benchmarks
    - Code quality and linting

## Implementation Strategy

### Step 1: Create Documentation Template
- Define standard format for each document
- Create template with sections for each component
- Establish naming conventions and file organization

### Step 2: Phase-by-Phase Documentation
- Start with Phase 1 (Foundation)
- Complete each document before moving to next
- Validate documentation with current system
- Iterate and refine based on findings

### Step 3: Validation & Testing
- Review each document for completeness
- Test documentation by attempting partial rebuilds
- Gather feedback and refine
- Finalize documentation for rewrite

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All system components documented
- [ ] Documentation enables complete rebuild
- [ ] Performance and scalability considerations captured
- [ ] Deployment and operational procedures documented
- [ ] Testing and quality assurance procedures defined

## Timeline Estimate
- **Phase 1**: 2-3 days (Foundation)
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 days (Core Systems)
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 days (API & Services)
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 days (Deployment & Operations)
- **Total**: 9-13 days for complete documentation

## Next Steps
1. Create documentation template
2. Begin with Phase 1, Document 1: Environment & Configuration
3. Iterate through each document systematically
4. Validate and refine documentation
5. Prepare for rewrite implementation

## Notes
- Each document should be self-contained but reference related documents
- Include code examples and configuration snippets
- Document both current state and desired improvements
- Capture lessons learned and architectural decisions
- Include troubleshooting and common issues
