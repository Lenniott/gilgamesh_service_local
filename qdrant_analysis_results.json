The Spanish Squat maximizes muscle force production at the very end of your knee extension range of motion, where most people are the weakest.

You will need to wrap the loop band around the anchor in front of you, just above knee height. The band should create two loops for you to place your feet through. After stepping through each loop, move the band up to your knee pits. Then, shuffle away from the anchor to create band tension\u2014at least enough so that you have to consciously keep your knees locked out to prevent the band from bending them forward. If necessary, grab onto something in front of you for balance. I prefer a squat rack or pull-up bar that has been bolted to the floor. At home, the base of a tree or a strong (and trusting) partner holding the band for you can work as an anchor.",

This will also help you secure the band in your hands when you squeeze your fists together. Use a foam mat, yoga mat, or rolled up towel to create a cushion between the floor and your knuckles. Feet lowered: If you have trouble performing this exercise on flat ground, use a bench or chair to elevate your upper body. Try to make your body form a 45-degree angle from the floor. If you are struggling with the Band Push-up Plus, I would rather you perform this variation with the band than revert to a traditional push-up with no band resistance. Feet raised: To increase the resistance, elevate your feet off the ground using a bench or chair. Serratus emphasis (not pictured): Another way to make this exercise more challenging and effective is to slide your hands a few inches toward your head. This will force the serratus muscles to contract harder and increase the load on your core.281",

This exercise has a different goal: improving shoulder stability in extended and protected positions.

Mobility training is a hot topic in fitness. Compared to several years ago, today it\u2019s much less common to see gym rats marching into the weight room and immediately performing high-intensity sets of bench presses or squats. Now, fitness fanatics spend countless hours stretching, mobilizing, stabilizing, massaging, and foam rolling before even thinking about picking up a weight or stepping onto a treadmill. Why? Because experts say limited mobility reduces athletic performance, causes pain, and leads to injury. Some studies support this. Collegiate athletes with tighter ligaments and muscles are more prone to injury, leading researchers to conclude that preseason flexibility programs \u201cmay decrease injuries.\u201d189",

But in practice, mobility training is often a colossal waste of time. Depending on when and how you implement mobility training, it can even increase injury risk and reduce muscular force potential. Besides, muscle and strength imbalances are more likely than limited mobility to cause injury. A 2016 study published in BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine found no relationship between mobility and injury risk, and that \u201cstrength asymmetry was statistically significant in predicting injury.\u201d190 This is not to say that it\u2019s OK to be so tight that you can\u2019t bend over to tie your shoelaces.

And if you\u2019re not adding more weight to these exercises each week, you\u2019re wasting your time. There are more than a few problems with applying this powerlifting-based mindset to everyone. First and foremost, many people lack the mobility and movement control to execute heavy loaded barbell movements safely. They would be better served focusing on exercises that establish proper movement patterns, build core stability, and stress the joints and muscles in ways that build them up instead of tear them down.",

They also build in submaximal effort training days in between max effort days for the same purpose. Your connective tissue and central nervous system need recovery periods to prevent breakdown. Demanding that your body add 5 to 10 pounds to each lift every week doesn\u2019t make sense. Nor does lifting hard and heavy every workout. A smarter approach involves shoring up weak points first and balancing traditional strength training with joint stabilizing work, mobility training, and corrective exercise.",

Make it a priority. The most common weak points that require some extra attention include the shoulder rotator cuff, upper back, entire posterior chain (hamstrings, glutes, low back), and wrist extensors and wrist supinators (rotating your hand to pinky side). Commonly tight muscles that create imbalances include the hamstrings, hip flexors, thoracic spine, anterior shoulder complex, lats, and wrist flexors. 3. Use a dynamic warm-up before each workout. Spend at least five minutes working on dynamic stretches that target your full body, with special attention to joint systems you\u2019ll be working that day. 4. Incorporate nontraditional exercises that challenge core stability, balance, coordination, and endurance. Train like an athlete. Be wary of machines and isolation movements.

One problem with this approach is that your muscles don\u2019t work in isolation. Each primary muscle has an entire cast of stabilizing muscles that surround it. If these smaller stabilizing muscles are neglected, muscle imbalances occur that quickly create movement faults, mobility restrictions, and joint irritation. To make matters worse, a muscle-only approach often exacerbates common muscle imbalances. For example, an exercise routine that leans on heavy pressing, rows, and lat pulldowns builds the shoulder\u2019s internal rotation muscles while neglecting the posterior (rear) muscles. This front-biased training combined with slouching over a desk all day causes shoulder impingement and pain. Not to mention, most bodybuilding routines blatantly neglect all exercise that doesn\u2019t have the pure purpose of building muscle mass. Mobility work, core stabilization training, endurance exercise, and joint-building movements all get left by the wayside. As time goes on and more loads are added to compromised joints, pain and injuries are inevitable.",

But if you can get four training sessions in per week, even if it means getting up earlier or rearranging your schedule, it\u2019s worth it. If not, that\u2019s OK. You can still make significant progress with three or even two sessions per week.

This allows you to practice trunk rotation movements while reducing injury risk since you are not holding heavy weights.

The traditional warm- up of steady-state cardio exercise and stretching has gone the way of the dodo bird, replaced by a new way of thinking about mobility training and movement preparation. You already know about many of the concepts we can leverage to prepare your body for exercise, including pumping more synovial fluid into joints and using dynamic stretching to loosen up joints and muscles. Now it\u2019s time to put them into a coordinated system. Corrective exercise: Without layering corrective exercise into your regular training program, you\u2019re building a house of cards, destined to fall when muscle imbalances inevitably lead to movement faults. This includes addressing motor control and mobility, training force couples around key joint systems, and shoring up weak points like your shoulder\u2019s rotator cuff. This concept is known as prehab: you\u2019re effectively implementing rehabilitative (rehab) movements designed for injury recovery and prevention into daily movement practices. This beats the old model of training as hard as you can, getting injured, completing physical therapy, then starting the whole process over. Traditional training goals: Training isn\u2019t only about preventing injury, it\u2019s also about building the capabilities of your body. This is the fun part. It includes neuromuscular coordination, strength, endurance, and agility. Connective tissue training: We can\u2019t forget about connective tissue training. Most people assume joint health is something that they gradually lose over time and there is nothing they can do about it.",

But this is backward. Despite popular opinion, tendon breakdown and joint dysfunction can only be fixed by increasing the load tolerance of connective tissues. And how is that accomplished? Rest? Stretching? Anti- inflammatories and injections? Nope. Only through load training. But it must be well planned and well executed. Your ability to choose the correct exercises, stabilize your joints, and perform movements effectively determines how your body responds to load-bearing training. If it breaks your body down, it\u2019s because either your tissues are not prepared for the load volume or specific movements are creating unnatural stress on your musculoskeletal system.",

Now, imagine there are no weights in the gym. No machines, pulleys, or barbells. Just the lifters in an empty room, doing the same movements. What do you see? It\u2019s a room full of people that appear to be practicing basic human movement patterns: squats, presses, rows, and lunges\u2014sometimes performing dozens of repetitions. This is all weight training is\u2014practicing and perfecting movement patterns under loads. It\u2019s the most functional and beneficial form of exercise there is. When you look at it this way, weightlifting morphs from a vanity-based hobby to a learned skill of absolute human necessity.",
