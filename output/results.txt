Description: I can deadlift 550 pounds and run a 500 mile ultramarathon - and these are 3 of my FAVORITE gym exercises:

	1.	Single Arm Barbell Press
This was the signature lift of old-time circus strongmen like Arthur Saxon, who famously pressed over 300 pounds overhead with one arm. In an era without steroids or machines, this lift built freakish strength and total-body control. The large bar forces your core, lats, and stabilizers to fire like crazy. Still the king of presses.

	2.	The Zercher March
Invented by St. Louis strongman Ed Zercher in the 1930s, this brutal movement was originally done with no racks—just Zercher Deadlifting the bar off the ground into the crook of the elbows. It became a staple for underground lifters who wanted real-world, combat-ready strength. Walking with it transforms your core, upper back, and grip into armor—and it has massive carryover to your deadlift and squat.

	3.	Bulgarian Split Squat
Made famous by the Bulgarian Olympic weightlifting team under coach Ivan Abadjiev, this unilateral powerhouse built some of the strongest legs in sports history. Unlike other Eastern Bloc nations, Bulgaria focused on high-frequency, high-intensity minimalist training—this was one of their secret weapons. Loaded or unloaded, it trains balance, raw leg strength, and fight-ready mobility. Every able-bodied person should master it.

All three of these movements are MAJOR players in my strength training routines.

[24.32s - 28.64s] your muscles, supercharging the pressing movement into a full body exercise.
[28.72s - 32.16s] The Zertra March is one of the most beneficial exercises anyone can do.
[32.16s - 36.64s] It not only builds the back and arms, but is also one of the best core exercises on the planet.
