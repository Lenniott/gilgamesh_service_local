Now, shift your weight back, extending your front leg, feel the hamstring stretch. Good! Now, ease back into the lunge, engaging those hip flexors in your back leg. Perfect! This is a great combo move that targets both your hamstrings and hip flexors. Remember, it's not about speed, but control and precision. Keep it smooth and steady, just like that!\"",

This is a fantastic stretch for your calves and hamstrings, but remember, we're also engaging those shoulders and core. Keep your movements smooth and controlled. You're doing great! Keep pushing, everyone! This is all about your body and your pace. Just focus on the stretch and the strength you're building. Keep it up!",
